# Q3

### (b)

#### The cases are given in time order. Prepare a time plot for the number of copiers serviced. What does your plot show?

### (c)

#### Prepare a stem-and-leaf plot of the residuals. Are there any noteworthy features in this plot?

### (d)

#### Prepare residual plots of ei versus Y; and el versus Xi on separate graphs. Do these plots provide the same information? What departures from regression model (2.1) can be studied from these plots? State your findings.

### (e)

#### Prepare a normal probability plot of the residuals. Also obtain the coefficient of correlation between the ordered residuals and their expected values under normality. Does the normality assumption appear to be tenable here? Use Table B.6 and a = .10.

### (f)

#### Prepare a time plot of the residuals to ascertain whether the error terms are correlated over time. What is your conclusion?

### (g)

#### Assume that (3.10) is applicable and conduct the Breusch-Pagan test to determine whether or not the error variance varies with the level of X. Use a = .05. State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion.

### (h)

#### Information is given below on two variables not included in the regression model, namely, mean operational age of copiers serviced on the call (X2' in months) and years of experience ofthe service person making the call (X3). Plot the residuals against X2 and X3 on separate -graphs to ascertain whether the model can be improved by including either or both of these variables. What do you conclude?
